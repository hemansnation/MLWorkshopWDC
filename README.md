What is Machine Learning?
● Machine Learning is the field of study that makes it possible for problems
to be solved by computers without requiring direct programming to be
implemented.
● Pillars of Machine Learning are Statistics, Linear Algebra, Calculus
and Probability

Regression and Classification
● Regression involves trying to estimate the relationship among
Variables, traditionally with statistical methods this involved
ordinary least squares (OLS), Machine Learning models attempt
to achieve the same, estimating the outcome for a real number.
● Classification involves determining the class of an outcome from
a discrete set of possible outcomes, traditionally this was
performed using logistics regression, Machine Learning models
are applied to attempt to determine the class of an
estimated outcome.

Feature Engineering and Data Cleaning
● One of the biggest challenges in Machine Learning is getting the
data in the optimal format and also extracting/encoding the
information in such a way that it's optimal for the model to
infer the desired outcome.
● Another challenge is dealing with noisy/erroneous data, which is
often the bulk of the initial Machine Learning Work.
